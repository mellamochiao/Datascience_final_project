# Surf Condition Forecasting Using XGBoost

## Overview
Taiwan is surrounded by ocean and hosts many world-famous surf spots such as Jinzun and Wushi Harbor. However, surfers often need to go to the beach in person to check for good waves. This project aims to build predictive models for wave conditions using publicly accessible weather and ocean data, providing surfers a tool to save time and make better surfing decisions.

## Data Collection

We used the [Surfline API](https://www.surfline.com/) via the `pysurfline` Python package to collect surf-related data for multiple international surf spots. Data was saved as CSV files for further analysis.

Main script: `surfline_crawl.ipynb`

## Model Building

We focused on predicting three key aspects of swell conditions:
1. **Swell Height**
2. **Swell Period**
3. **Swell Power**

Each target variable was predicted using both Linear Regression (for baseline evaluation) and XGBoost (for optimized performance).

### Highlights:

- **Swell height (XGBoost):**  
  MSE = 0.065  
  RÂ² = 0.893

- **Swell period (XGBoost):**  
  MSE = 1.145  
  RÂ² = 0.770

- **Swell power (XGBoost):**  
  MSE = 2618.05  
  RÂ² = 0.927

## Surf Condition Predictor

We developed a terminal-based application to predict surf conditions using the trained models. The program allows users to input basic weather data and outputs predicted swell height, period, power, and a surf suitability suggestion.

### Key Features:
- Predicts swell height, period, and power using XGBoost
- Surf suitability assessment:
  - Good: Swell period between 8â€“16 sec
  - Acceptable: Swell period 6â€“8 sec with offshore wind
- Warnings:
  - **High wind alert:** wind speed > 19 m/s
  - **Low temperature alert:** temperature < 20Â°C

Script: [`surf_predict.py`](https://github.com/mellamochiao/Datascience_final_project/blob/main/surf_predict.py)

## Discussion

Our results show that the models perform well in predicting key swell metrics using accessible weather inputs. Future improvements could include:
- Incorporating coastal geography (e.g., shoreline shape, slope)
- Analyzing interactions between coastline and wind angles
- Building a user-friendly UI/UX interface
